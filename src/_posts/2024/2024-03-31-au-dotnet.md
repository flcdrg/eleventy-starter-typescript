I maintain quite a few [Chocolatey packages](https://community.chocolatey.org/profiles/flcdrg). The source for these packages lives in [https://github.com/flcdrg/au-packages/](https://github.com/flcdrg/au-packages/), and until recently I used the [AU PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AU) to detect and publish updated versions of the packages.

The first issue was that unfortunately, the original maintainer of the AU module archived the project on GitHub. The Chocolatey Community stepped in and is now maintaining a fork [here](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-au).

The second issue I hit that was causing issues was a compatibility issue with newer versions of PowerShell 7. AU was originally written for Windows PowerShell 5, but I have made extensive use of features of PowerShell 6 and 7 in my update scripts. That didn't seem to cause issues until the GitHub Actions agents were [updated from PowerShell 7.2 to 7.4 in January](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/9115).

The specific problem would reveal itself like this:

```text
Chocolatey had an error occur: System.ArgumentException: File specified is either not found or not a .nupkg file. 'D:\a\au-packages\au-packages\microsoft-teams.install\microsoft-teams.install.1.7.0.3653.nupkg '
```

For some reason, the AU module was able to generate a new version of a package, but when it called the Chocolatey CLI (`choco.exe`) and passed the path to the nupkg file, it appeared that there was a trailing space in the filename!

I spent hours trying to debug this to no avail. This was not made any easier by the fact that AU uses [PowerShell Jobs](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_jobs?view=powershell-7.4&WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5001655) to spin up separate processes for each package so they can be processed in parallel. I could not get debugging to work inside a Job when using the Visual Studio Code PowerShell debugger. Even the old-style debugging approach of `Write-Host "I got here"` didn't work very well as all output of the job is captured isn't easy to extract (let alone being able to inspect the original variables as proper objects rather than serialised strings)

Eventually, I decided I was wasting my time trying to solve this, and maybe if I rewrote the updating logic myself I could mitigate the issue.

There are essentially two parts to the AU module - the bits that support updating an individual package, and then there are the bits that run over all your packages. It's that second part that makes use of PowerShell Jobs and I suspected was the source of the problem.

I figured rewriting that part in C#/.NET would mean I had a much nicer debugging experience (should I need it). I wanted to leave the individual package updating alone - it would be a significant effort to migrate all the custom `update.ps1` scripts to something else.

### au-dotnet

And so [au-dotnet](https://github.com/flcdrg/au-dotnet) was born.

It is a reasonably simple .NET 8 console application that iterates over all the packages in my au-packages repository, and then calls the PowerShell `update.ps1` script in each to see if there is a new version to generate and publish.

Rather than just call out to the operating system to run each `update.ps1` script, I decided to embed PowerShell in the application. This gives me a bit more control over how the scripts are run and the ability to capture any script output (and errors) from each run.

#### Hosting PowerShell

Figuring out how to host PowerShell in a .NET 8 application took a little bit of research. Many of the articles you find (and even some of the official documentation) are still aimed at Windows PowerShell.

The key was to reference these three NuGet packages (and use the same version of each package):

- Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Diagnostics
- Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK
- System.Management.Automation

You can then create a [PowerShell Class](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.powershell?view=powershellsdk-7.4.0&WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5001655) instance like this:

```csharp
var iss = InitialSessionState.CreateDefault2();
iss.ExecutionPolicy = Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicy.RemoteSigned;

var ps = PowerShell.Create(iss);
```

You can capture any output via the [`Streams`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.powershell.streams?view=powershellsdk-7.4.0&WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5001655) property. eg. Here I am logging any errors from PowerShell as a GitHub Action error:

```csharp
ps.Streams.Error.DataAdded += (_, args) =>
{
    core.WriteError(ps.Streams.Error[args.Index].ToString());
};
```

Running specific PowerShell cmdlets can be done via the [`AddCommand`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.powershell.addcommand?view=powershellsdk-7.4.0&WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5001655) method. eg.

```csharp
ps.AddCommand("Set-Location").AddParameter("Path", directory).Invoke();
```

Whereas running arbitrary PowerShell scripts is done via the [`AddScript`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.powershell.addscript?view=powershellsdk-7.4.0&WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5001655) method. eg.

```csharp
ps.AddScript("$ErrorView = 'DetailedView'").Invoke();
```

If the script is in a separate `.ps1` file, the only way I've found so far is to load that file into a string and pass it in. It would be nicer if you could point it at the file (so debugging/errors could include line numbers) but I have yet to find a way to do that.

```csharp
var output = ps.AddScript(File.ReadAllText(Path.Combine(directory, "update.ps1")))
.Invoke();
```

One thing to remember is you must call the [`Invoke`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.powershell.invoke?view=powershellsdk-7.4.0&WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5001655) method to actually run the scripts or commands you've just added.

#### GitHub Action logging and summary

Because I know the application will be run in a GitHub Actions workflow, I made use of the excellent [GitHub.Actions.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GitHub.Actions.Core) NuGet package for formatting output, as well as generating a nice build summary that lists all packages that were updated in the current run.

#### Commit and publish

If a new package is created (eg. a `.nupkg` file now exists) then we assume this file can be submitted to the Chocolatey Community Repository. `choco push` is then called to upload the package. Remember this was where we hit that error with the trailing space? Pleasingly the .NET version doesn't exhibit this behaviour, so that problem is solved.

Assuming the package is submitted successfully then we call `git`` to stage any modified files from this package and add a tag indicating the package that was updated.

After all packages have been processed, we will commit all staged files and push the commit back to the repo, so that we get a version history of all the package changes.

#### Enhancements

I am currently using my fork of the chocolatey-au module, which has one minor enhancement. It adds a `Files` collection property to the `AUPackage` PowerShell class. This collection is populated with the paths of all the files that were downloaded (and had their checksums calculated).

I make use of this for some of my packages to pre-emptively upload the files to VirusTotal. This can help fast-track the packages being approved by Chocolatey as it means the Chocolatey virus scanning step is already completed. Because I use the [VirusTotal CLI](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vt-cli) tool for this, it also means I can upload files [up to 650MB](https://github.com/VirusTotal/vt-cli/issues/33#issuecomment-850213255) (compared to Chocolatey's current 200MB limit due to using an older API).

I have [submitted the Files property enhancement](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-au/pull/53) to chocolatey-au.
