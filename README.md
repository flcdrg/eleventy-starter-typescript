# eleventy-starter-typescript

Based on <https://github.com/eszterkv/eleventy-starter-typescript>


## Updated Packages

This project uses updated packages including TypeScript (`^5.4.5`) and Eleventy (`^2.0.1`) as listed in the `package.json`. These updates enhance the development experience and performance of the project.

## Transition to TypeScript

The configuration for `.eleventy.js` has been transitioned to TypeScript, allowing for type-safe configuration and better development practices. The configuration can be found in `.eleventy.ts`, which outlines the setup and options used for generating the site.

## Site Output Structure

The site output structure is designed to closely mirror my existing Jekyll-based blog, generated layout like /yyyy/mm/post-title.html etc.
